Conclusion

So far, the highest possible is +11. There is no possible low
score, but the lowest that I'd score is probably about -10,
though, I doubt I'd talk to such a person long enough to score
them this low, but we'll see.

I do suggest cutting the people out of one's life who are below
zero, however.

My plan is to be friends with the top three, only. If there's
someone new who comes in higher, then the lower scorers will
be slowly phased out.
