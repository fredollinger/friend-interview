I have not totally worked out my process yet, but basically,
when I meet someone new, I'd like to screen out really harmful
traits as quickly as possible while giving the person a chance
to put themselves in the best light.

So the idea is to create a wonderful conversation.

Also, I'd like to hold myself to my own lists.   

These lists are of positive and negative traits. Positive traits
get points while negative traits obviously, lose them.

I have not worked out a cut off score, yet, but for now, they
should definitely be above zero.
