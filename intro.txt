This was inspired by the book _Who's Got Your Back by Keith 
Ferrazii as well as the standup routine by Cindy Lu called the
"Four Man Plan."

Some of the assumptions of this are that making friends is a 
statistical phenomenom. That is, there are only so many people
whom we "click" with and that the more people we meet the more
likely we are to make good friends.

This is why I talk to as many strangers as possible.

On the other hand, we need to have friends who really help us
out.

At first, I thought that this was selfish, but I have run into
some problems when I tried to befriend just anyone who would
befriend me.

Thus, I have decided that I'm trying to screen out toxic people
as quickly as possible.

I don't mean to be mean when I say "toxic" as I believe that
we are all wonderful people deep inside, but when you
befriend someone you usually deal with their very superficial
exterior and thus this is what I'm going to examine.
